#PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
This portfolio website, created using HTML and CSS, showcases my skills and projects as a Computer Science Engineering student. It features a responsive design with sections for an introduction, services offered, technical and soft skills, education, professional experience, and a contact form. Utilizing Font Awesome for icons, this project aims to present my expertise in a visually appealing manner. To view the website, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. For more information, you can contact me.
